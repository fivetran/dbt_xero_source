# dbt_xero_source v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_xero_source v0.3.0

## Features
- Allow for multiple sources by unioning source tables across multiple Xero connectors.
([#11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source/pull/11))
  - Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source#unioning-multiple-xero-connectors) for more details.

## Under the Hood
- Unioning: The unioning occurs in the tmp models using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. ([#11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source/pull/11))
- Unique tests: Because columns that were previously used for unique tests may now have duplicate fields across multiple sources, these columns are combined with the new `source_relation` column for unique tests and tested using the `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` macro. ([#11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source/pull/11))
- Source Relation column: To distinguish which source each field comes from, we added a new `source_relation` column in each staging model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro. ([#11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source/pull/11))
